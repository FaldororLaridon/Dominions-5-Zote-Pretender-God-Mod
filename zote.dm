#name "Grey Prince"
#fixedname "Zote"
#descr "Out of every creature and being with divine power, Zote may be the least deserving of it. Showing scorn to everyone he met, wielding a weapon completely incapable of damaging his opponents, he was the laughingstock of the denizens of Hallownest. After taking credit for another's deeds, one bug put so much faith into Zote that she crafted him into a False God. Now, he wields immense power and strength when others believe in him, but returns to his weak and frail self when he has no believers. He reigns as the Grey Prince, and seeks to claim the throne of the Pantokrator, and make himself truly powerful."
